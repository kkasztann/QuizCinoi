## About project
*Our application helps users to extend their knowledge from any field they want. We create a quiz app, which is a fun and intuitive way to test users and theirs friends skills.
We decided to give users freedom to choose category of quiz ( one of the possible six: Computers, General, Nature, History, Geography, Maths ). They can also decide about form and difficulty of questions.
Thanks to that, users can create any quiz they want and find useful.
To extend a experience of using our application we create a possibility for our users to challenge theirs friends.
Whats more fun than nice evening with your loved ones and some quizzes.*
